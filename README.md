# Web-Boilerplate

### What

A lean and mean setup for creating web front-ends.

### Why

I frequently need to set up new projects so it was worth the time to standardize and improve on this formula each time. Static HTML is great for caching and CDN performance, so this setup is perfect for Ember apps, Parse apps or your own applicaton. After writing thousands of lines of CSS, I've fallen in love with Stylus, so that and many awesome goodies are included. 


### How

Download and unzip the repository.

`cd` into thee project folder and run `npm install` to download the necessary build files.

Then run `grunt` to build a development version and use `grunt watch` to rebuild when files change with `livereload` support. The compiled files will be in `build/`.

The directory structure looks like:
  
    ▸ build/ <--- resultant build files
	▾ css/
	  ▸ elements/
	  ▸ pages/
	  ▸ polyfill/
	  ▸ scaffolding/ <!-- Layout, Grid, etc.
	  ▸ typography/
	    effects.styl
	    footer.styl
	    ie8.styl
	    navbar.styl
	    reset.styl
	    styles.styl <--- The main stylesheet
	    utils.styl
	    variables.styl
	▸ js/
	▸ node_modules/
	▸ pages/ <!--- HTML goes here. Sub folders are supported.
	▾ static/
	  ▸ font/
	  ▾ images/
	  ▸ js/    <!--- one-off javascript files only (will not be preprocessed)
	  ▸ video/
	▸ templates/
	  Gruntfile.js
	  package.json
	  README.md


Run `grunt production` to build a production version complete with minified and obfuscated code; run `grunt staging` to build with production preprocessors, but without the obfuscation (good for debugging in production mode).



### Goodies

##### Preprocessing

All javascript and HTML are preprocessed.

This means you can do neat things like

	in javascript:
	//@ifdef DEBUG
	  console.log('Debug statement)
	//@endif

	in html:
	<!-- @ifdef PRODUCTION -->
	<script src='analytics.js></script>
	<!-- @endif -->

And the resultant text will be included/discluded according to the build type.


##### Grid System

Included is a modified version of Semantic UIs grid system. I have experimented with *many* grid systems and have found Semantic's to be the most flexible, powerful and, well, semantic. More info and features is available at Semantic's Website.


	The grid is percentage based, so each column here will be 20% of the *grid's* parent
	<div class='five column grid'>
	  <div class='column'>1</>
	  <div class='column'>2</>
	  <div class='column'>3</>
	  <div class='column'>4</>
	  <div class='column'>5</>
	</div>

	It also supports multiple rows and variable column widths. 
	In `twelve wide` grids, all column widths add up to twelve.
	<div class='twelve wide grid'>
	   <div class='row'>
	      <div class='three wide column'>3</div>
	      <div class='nine wide column'>9</div>
	   </div>
	   <div class='row'>
	      <div class='four wide column'>4</div>
	      <div class='five wide column'>5</div>
	      <div class='three wide column'>3</div>
	   </div>
	</div>
